## GIFs

#### Sometimes videos aren't necessarily needed to convey an idea, especially considered how labor-intensive they are. I've found GIFs to be a fine way to show quick things. The added benefit is users can watch the specific task they're trying to do multiple times without having to scroll through a video to get there or manually rewind to watch again.

#### To make GIFs, I've primarily used Camtasia. I know that you can make them in Photoshop as well without too much difficulty. 

### Adding YaleLinks to MyNCBI
#### This is a question we get over email a lot in Medical and there isn't really a succint way to describe this process in writing. I created this GIF for my colleagues to send out and it's been received well.

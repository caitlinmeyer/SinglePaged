#### Video

# Process &amp; tools

*Creating a storyboard*
For scripting and figuring out what visuals I would want to accompany narration, I use a simple template in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmHfOMS1tLx0wxdH7pJGQiC9abbVBvAQHB3hOhjWnWk/edit?usp=sharing)

*Screen capture*
A lot of library tutorials are showing users how to do something on a website, and screen casting is a great way to demonstrate. Though there are various programs that do this, I use [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) because it lets you bring in an audio track and cut it all together. 

*Animation*
For making things move, you can do a lot in Camtasia. For a more refined aesthetic or advanced types of illustration, I like to use [Hype3](https://tumult.com/hype/). Though technically software for creating HTML5 things, you can export high quality video files and add them to your project. 

*Audio*
[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is great for recording and editing audio and is free.

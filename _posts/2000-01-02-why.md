# Process &amp; tools

### Creating a storyboard
#### For scripting and figuring out what visuals I would want to accompany narration, I use a simple template in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmHfOMS1tLx0wxdH7pJGQiC9abbVBvAQHB3hOhjWnWk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Screen capture
#### A lot of library tutorials are showing users how to do something on a website, and screen casting is a great way to demonstrate. Though there are various programs that do this, I use [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) because it lets you bring in an audio track and cut it all together. 

### Animation
#### For making things move, you can do a lot in Camtasia. For a more refined aesthetic or advanced types of illustration, I like to use [Hype3](https://tumult.com/hype/). Though technically software for creating HTML5 things, you can export high quality video files and add them to your project. 

### Audio
#### [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is great for recording and editing audio and is free. 
  
### Adobe Suite
#### At various point to either convert images into vectors or edit sections of images, I've also needed to use Photoshop and Illustrator. I've played with Premier to assemble final products, but the simplicity of Camtasia has been sufficient for these projects.   
  

# Examples

### Bioinformatics at Yale
#### More informational than an instructional object, this video uses all of the tools listed above. <BR>

### Literature Reviews
#### This one comes from my time at UCLA and used the atrociously awful software Videoscribe for the animation. Though it fit the DIY aesthetic we were going for as a team, the user interface is confusing and it freezes pretty often. <BR>

### Process & tools 
#### Interactive slideshows are a neat way to tie all of the content together. Using reveal.js, you can create slideshows that respect user time and agency by creating multiple paths through the content. They have the ability to navigate side to side for top-level, important information and can navigate downwards for more assistance or directions presented in a different way. 

### Reveal.js
#### [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) allows you to build beautiful, responsive slideshows in simple HTML, and store and host them on [Github](https://github.com).

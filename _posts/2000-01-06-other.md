## Other
#### Here are a couple of other idea's I've seen played with and could be used for library instruction.

### Simple websites
#### The page you're currently on is a static website built with Jekyll on Github and published by Github Pages. The great thing about all three of those things is that you don't need a lot of techincal know-how to use them. This website, for example, took about two hours to set up and is now a central home for my toolkit. There are thousands of Jekyll templates on the web and you merely have to add your content to make the site. The [UCLA Research Tips](https://www.ulcalibrary.github.io/research-tips) page is built in a similar way and also is now a centralized home for all the great work they're doing. 

### Google Drive 
#### A project my teammate Shannon spent a lot of time on last year was the [Research Paper Planner](http://bit.ly/paper-planner). Students duplicate this Google Sheets document and customize it with their details. If they want, they can share it with their professor so both parties can keep tabs on a students' progress throughout the term. 

### HTML5
#### Before I left UCLA, I was working on intense interactive learning object teaching students how to navigate databases. It looks like since I've left they opted for a video format instead of HTML5, but you can see some examples of other HTML5 tutorials my colleagues built out: [writing/reading abstracts](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/research-abstracts/) and [elevator speeches](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/deconstructing-the-elevator-speech/).

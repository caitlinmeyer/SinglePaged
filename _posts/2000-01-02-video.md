# Process &amp; tools

### Creating a storyboard
#### For scripting and figuring out what visuals I would want to accompany narration, I use a simple template in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmHfOMS1tLx0wxdH7pJGQiC9abbVBvAQHB3hOhjWnWk/edit?usp=sharing). Google Docs and all the applications in Drive are free.

### Screen capture
#### A lot of library tutorials are showing users how to do something on a website, and screen casting is a great way to demonstrate. Though there are various programs that do this, I use [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) because it lets you bring in an audio track and cut it all together. A license for Camtasia runs about $160.

### Animation
#### For making things move, you can do a lot in Camtasia. For a more refined aesthetic or advanced types of illustration, I like to use [Hype3](https://tumult.com/hype/). Though technically software for creating HTML5 things, you can export high quality video files and add them to your project. Hype3 at the eduacation rate is around $60. 

### Icons
#### Something really useful for getting images to use in your animations is the [Noun Project](https://nounproject.com). You can use the icons for free if you credit the author, or pay a nominal fee to use the icons freely. 

### Audio
#### [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is great for recording and editing audio and is free. 
  
### Adobe Suite
#### At various points to either convert images into vectors or edit sections of images, I've also needed to use Photoshop and Illustrator. I've played with Premiere to assemble final products, but the simplicity of Camtasia has been sufficient for these projects. The Adobe Suite is available free to everybody at Yale through the ITS software library.

### Bioinformatics at Yale
#### More informational than an instructional object, this video uses all of the tools listed above. <BR>

### Literature Reviews
#### This one comes from my time at UCLA. We used a program called Videoscribe, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend for a number of reasons. However, it's totally possible to make this aesthetic happen between the Noun Project, Camtasia and Hype3 if you want.<BR>

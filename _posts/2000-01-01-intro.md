# Caitlin's instructional media toolkit


Examples of previous work for RIO, March 2018. 

Included on this site are a variety of instructional media I've worked on here at Yale and also in my time in graduate school at UCLA, including: animated videos, HTML5 tutorials, instructional GIFs, interactive slideshows, and more. You'll also find what tools were used for each object and at what point in the creation process they were deployed. 

This is in no way intended to be an exhaustive list of useful tools or even the best tools, just what I've had acccess to and worked with.

Enjoy!

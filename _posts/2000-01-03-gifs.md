## Process & tools

#### Sometimes videos aren't necessarily needed to convey an idea, especially considered how labor-intensive they are. I've found GIFs to be a fine way to show quick things. The added benefit is users can watch the specific task they're trying to do multiple times without having to scroll through a video to get there or manually rewind to watch again.

### Making the video 
#### The GIFs I've made are simply short, looped videos. GIFs don't support audio so you only have to worry about producing visuals. I've primarily used Camtasia as they have an easy export process, but I know that you can make them in Photoshop as well without too much difficulty. 

### Adding YaleLinks to MyNCBI
#### This is a question we get over email a lot in Medical and there isn't really a succint way to describe this process in writing. I created this GIF for my colleagues to send out and it's been received well.

### Zotero Series
#### Here are a few I made at UCLA to illustrate simple tasks in citation management software Zotero.
